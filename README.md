## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM (Beginner)

### What I learned

I wrote my first project with BEM as I want to have a better overview for reading my CSS project. I prepare myself with working correctly so people can understand my project and feel familiar with the CSSguidline.
